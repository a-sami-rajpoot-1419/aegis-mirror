Project: The Mirror Vault
High-Level Design & Requirements Document
1. Executive Summary
The Mirror Vault is a custom hybrid blockchain built using the Cosmos SDK, CometBFT (Tendermint), and the Cosmos EVM (Ethermint) framework. Its primary innovation is Unified Identity Mapping, where a single private key controls a "wallet pair" (Keplr and MetaMask) that is mathematically and statefully synced. The project demonstrates a "Digital Safety Deposit Box" where business logic is split between EVM smart contracts and native Cosmos modules.

2. Project Principles
One Key, Two Worlds: A user should never "bridge" tokens between their own accounts on the same chain; the balance should exist in a single unified store.

Mathematical Mirroring: Address conversion between 0x... (Hex) and mirror1... (Bech32) must be actual, not symbolic.

Hybrid Execution: Complex logic runs in Solidity (EVM), while high-performance data storage runs in Golang (Cosmos SDK).

3. Functional Requirements (High-Level)
A. Core Infrastructure & Compatibility
EVM Compatibility: Full support for Solidity smart contracts, Ethereum JSON-RPC (Port 8545), and Web3 tooling (Hardhat, Foundry).

Cosmos Foundation: Built on Cosmos SDK with BFT consensus via CometBFT, supporting native gRPC and REST interfaces.

The "Mirror" Configuration: The chain must be configured with BIP-44 CoinType 60 and EthSecp256k1 keys to ensure Keplr and MetaMask derive the exact same account from one mnemonic.

B. Unified Wallet Experience (The Mirror Sync)
Real-Time Sync: A transaction performed in Keplr (e.g., MsgSend) must immediately reflect in the MetaMask balance, as they share the same underlying Bank module store.

Multi-Pair Support: Users can manage multiple account pairs (Account #1, Account #2) and transfer tokens between different pairs using either wallet interface.

Bidirectional Address Visibility: The UI must display both formats simultaneously. Clicking "Convert" should show the mathematical derivation from Hex to Bech32.

C. Business Logic: The Digital Safety Deposit Box
EVM Logic (The Lock): A Solidity contract (VaultManager.sol) serves as the gatekeeper. Users pay a "Registration Fee" in tokens via MetaMask to unlock their vault.

Cosmos Logic (The Vault): A custom Go module (x/vault) manages the actual storage of text-based "secrets."

Inter-VM Communication: Once the EVM contract receives payment, it triggers a Precompile (Go-side hook) that authorizes the user's Cosmos address to write to the x/vault store.

D. Gas Fee Analysis
Comparison Engine: The system must provide a side-by-side comparison of Gas costs for the same business action (e.g., "Cost to store 1KB of text via EVM SSTORE" vs "Cost to store 1KB via Cosmos KVStore").

Dual-Fee Handling: Transactions signed via MetaMask use Ethereum-style gas; those via Keplr use Cosmos-style gas, both hitting the same native token.

4. Scope & Technical Architecture
5. Success Metrics (The "Acheiveables")
Zero-Latency Balance Sync: Sending tokens via mirrorvaultd (CLI) results in an instant balance change in MetaMask.

Mathematical Integrity: Verifying that 0x123... and mirror1... always share the same Private Key.

Cross-VM Success: An action in Solidity successfully "unlocks" a permission in a native Go module.
