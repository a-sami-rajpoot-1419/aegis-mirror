1. Core System Architecture
The system is a Sovereign Layer 1 built on the Cosmos SDK, utilizing CometBFT for consensus and Cosmos EVM (Ethermint) for execution.

The "Mirror" Principle (The Unified Account)
Requirement: Mathematical identity between 0x... (Ethereum) and mirror1... (Cosmos).

Implementation: The chain must use BIP-44 CoinType 60 (Ethereum's path) and EthSecp256k1 (Ethereum’s curve) for all accounts.

Mechanism: When a user provides a private key, the chain derives a public key hash. This hash is then encoded twice: once as Hex (for EVM) and once as Bech32 (for Cosmos). They are the same account.

2. Technical Stack
Blockchain Framework: Cosmos SDK (v0.50+)

Consensus Engine: CometBFT (v0.38+)

EVM Library: cosmos/evm (The maintained successor to Ethermint)

Language: Go (Golang) 1.21+ for chain logic; Solidity 0.8.20+ for EVM logic.

UI/Frontend: Next.js (TypeScript), Tailwind CSS.

Libraries: ethers.js (EVM interaction), @cosmjs/stargate (Cosmos interaction).

DevOps: Docker, Docker-Compose, Ignite CLI.

3. Phase 1: Custom Chain Construction
Task 1.1: Project Scaffolding
Initialize a new chain with the correct address prefix:

Task 1.2: Account Configuration (The Identity Bridge)
You must override the default Cosmos account types.

Modify app/app.go: Configure the AccountKeeper and AuthKeeper to use ethermint.EthAccount.

Set BIP-44: In the chain configuration (config.yml), set the default coin type to 60.

Result: mirrorvaultd keys add will now generate addresses that start with mirror1 but share the same private key as a 0x address.

Task 1.3: Custom Business Logic Module (x/vault)
Create a Go module to store text data.

Store Type: map[string]string (Address -> Encrypted/Plain Text).

Message: MsgStoreSecret (Sender, Text).

Logic: A "Pre-Run" check that verifies if the user has an "Unlock Credit" (granted by the EVM side).

4. Phase 2: Inter-VM Business Logic
The "Mirror Lock" Workflow
Solidity Contract (VaultGate.sol): A simple contract with a payToUnlock() function. When called, it emits an Unlocked(address user) event.

Go Precompile: You will implement a Stateful Precompile in the Go source code.

Address: 0x00...000101 (Custom).

Function: When payToUnlock() is called in Solidity, it executes the Precompile.

Action: The Precompile writes directly to the Cosmos SDK x/vault state to increment a "StorageCredit" counter for that user's address.

5. Phase 3: Frontend & UI Specification
Layout Design
Theme: Dark Mode (Background: #0D1117, Primary: #58A6FF).

Top Bar: * Left: Mirror Vault Logo.

Right: "Connect Wallets" button (Triggering both MetaMask and Keplr).

Main Dashboard (Split View):

Left Column (EVM): Displays 0x address, ETH balance, and "Pay to Unlock" button.

Right Column (Cosmos): Displays mirror1 address, native coin balance, and "Save Secret" text area.

Center Conversion Tool: A box that takes any 0x address and instantly shows the mirror1 equivalent using the Bech32 encoding formula.

Real-Time Logs (The Debug Bar)
Position: Bottom 20% of the screen.

Style: Terminal-like (Black background, green text).

Functionality:

Stream every event from the chain (JSON-RPC and gRPC).

"Copy TX Hash" button next to every log.

Highlight errors in red.

6. Phase 4: Testing & Documentation
